# Craigslist-Scraper
Website built to scrape Craigslist for cars that have an annual mileage less than or equal to a specified number. Default search scrapes a list of 25 cars from [Santander Consumer USA](https://santanderconsumerusa.com/blog/25-vehicles-that-hold-value-best-over-five-years-iseecars-com), but user unique searches are also allowed. The CSV files used as a "database" can also be refreshed, however it is very slow. The frontend was built using HTML and Bootstrap, and the backend was built in Python using Flask and Beautiful Soup 4. Project for CS 232, Python Programming.

# Imports:
* pip install beautifulsoup4
* pip install flask
* pip install Flask-WTF
